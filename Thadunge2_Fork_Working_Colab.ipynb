        " - If this cell gives you an error, try replacing the first cell with this parameters to install missing dependencies (it might be possible that future updates to the GitHub fork require more dependencies) (if you copy pasted the paramaters in one go, you will also have to delete the blank spaces left in the cell), run it, and it 'should' solve the problem:\n",
